In a bike-sharing system, the availability of bikes in the different stations is a critical point of the system; a customer that cannot take a bike at a station as he planned will be frustrated and potentially lost.  For the bike network manager, this implies a constant rebalancing of the bikes present in the network according to the daily demand that strongly varies depending on many factors (weather conditions, local events, date, etc.). By using bike usage predictive and rebalancing algorithms, this project will minimize the rebalancing tasks that must be performed by the bike network manager while ensuring an optimal quality of service for the final customer. 
The developed system will be applied and evaluated in real conditions on three different bike networks managed by Intermobility SA in early 201
